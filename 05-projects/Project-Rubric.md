# Project Rubric

## Overview

**Note: This applies to all projects throughout the course**

Be subjective in the gradient (-, +) of the letter grade. Give specific feedback students can take action on for future projects.

**Grade by Group**

Give the same grade & feedback to each student within the group.

### Grading Guidelines

1. Did the group present and demo their project?

2. Did every group member speak during the presentation?

3. Did they deploy their project? (Github Pages or Heroku)

4. Did they meet all project requirements?

#### 4/4 (A)

#### 3/4 (B)

#### 2/4 (C)

#### 1/4 (D)

#### 0/4 (F)

#### Empty Repository (I)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the group has still attempted the project and were unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
