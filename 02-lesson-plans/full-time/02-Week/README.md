## Intro to JavaScript / Intro to jQuery

### Overview

In this unit, we will be introducing students to their first taste of JavaScript. They will then use their newfound understanding of variables, arrays, loops, and conditionals to create a simple WordGuess or Psychic Guessing Game.

Then will be introducing students to jQuery. Students will understand the basic concepts of DOM manipulation, on-click events, and basic GUI building. By the end of the unit they will deepen their understanding of JavaScript scope.

### Learning Objectives

* By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
  * Explain the fundamentals of building JavaScript programs to increase employer readiness.
  * Update HTML with JavaScript query selectors to dynamically change static webpages.
  * Loop through arrays in order to dynamically manipulate data.
  * Create and parse JavaScript objects to ensure cohesiveness in their applications.
  * Use jQuery to dynamically render elements to a webpage from application state, giving static websites more app-like functionality.
  * Listen to and response to user events to improve interactivity in their web apps.
  * Explain the concept of the DOM, how its relation to the HTML document, and the rendered webpage.
