## Data Persistence with Local and Server Storage

### Overview

In this unit, we are starting to work with data-persistence. We will cover client-side data storage (localStorage and cookies), as well as server-side storage (Firebase).

### Learning Objectives

* By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
  * Incorporate cookies and sessions into web apps for persistent user experiences.
  * Set up Firebase systems to store remote data.
  * Build apps that collect user input and save them to the cloud using AJAX in tandem with Firebaseâ€™s API.
  * Explain the key components of compelling web applications.
  * Conceptualize and build creative apps that rely on outside data sources.
  * Assign tasks and resolve merge conflicts using Git and GitHub.

### Key Topics

* Client-side storage
* Remote data management
