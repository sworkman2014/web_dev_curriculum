## Week 22 - Computer Science

### Overview

This week's lesson plans will introduce students to the fundamental concepts and terminology of computer science. The intent is to provide them with just enough to contextualize technical interview questions and enable further study. We intentionally omit rigorous exercises to allow students to focus on projects.
