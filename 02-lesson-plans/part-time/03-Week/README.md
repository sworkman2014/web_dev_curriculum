## Unit 3 - Intro to JavaScript

### Overview

In this week we will be introducing students to their first taste of JavaScript. They will then use their newfound understanding of variables, arrays, loops, and conditionals to create a simple WordGuess or Psychic Guessing Game.

### Learning Objectives

* By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
  * Explain the fundamentals of building JavaScript programs to increase employer readiness.
